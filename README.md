## Machine Learning - just do it ! 
#### mellow is a python package that contains some well known machine learning algorithms.
#### Exclusive to first time learner.
It provides:
- most popular machine learning algorithms
- sophisticated utility functions useful in these algorithms
- and much more

Often Developers/Students feel hesitation to implement the machine learning algorithms because</br>
either they find it hefty or time consuming, what I believe is understanding the machine learning</br> 
algorithms and the mathematics behind these algorithms is much more important than converting it into</br> 
code. So I come up with this beautiful library mellow to help you out.


### Installation using pip
- pip install mellow
